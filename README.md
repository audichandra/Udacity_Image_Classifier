# Udacity_Image_Classifier
The second project of Udacity machine learning introduction where I applied deep learning in order to train the image classifier in recognizing flower species. By building and training the classifier with vgg16 as the architecture, I test the model in order to reach the 80% accuracy threshold and saved it in order to continue the project without having to retrain the network again. There is also a need to adjust the image in centering and resizing so the image can appear appropriately. Finally, I also use the topk tensor so that we can predict the image with the top five flower species candidates for the image.
